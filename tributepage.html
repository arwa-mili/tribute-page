                    Dame Zaha Mohammad Hadid was hands down the most famous female architect in the world by the time of her death, and for good reason. Her work changed the face of modern architecture and revolutionized the way we build. She was described by The Guardian
                    as “The Queen of the Curve”.Zaha Hadid was once the highest paid architect in the world.

                <h3 align="center">Early & Personal life</h3>
                <p class="info">Hadid was born in Baghdad, Iraq. However, she lived abroad through most of her childhood, attending Catholic boarding schools in Switzerland and England which she described as religiously diverse, before studying mathematics at the American
                    University of Beirut. Her father, Mohammed Hadid, was a politician who co-founded the left-liberal al-Ahali group in 1932. Due to her father’s involvement in politics, she used to make trips to the ancient Sumerian cities in southern
                    Iraq, which she once mentioned in an interview, sparked her interest in architecture. The family however had to leave Iraq because of the Iranian war and the Saddam Hussein conflicts. Before her fame as an architect, she had a successful
                    teaching career at several institutions. These included the ‘Harvard Graduate School of Design’ and the ‘University of Illinois’ at ‘Chicago’s School of Architecture’.
